# Overview
A modern, visually striking Kanban board web application built with Next.js 15 and React 19. The application features a glassmorphic design with sophisticated 3D interactions, providing users with an elegant and intuitive project management tool. The focus is on creating a beautiful, performant single-board experience rather than a complex multi-board system.

# Core Features

1. Modern Glassmorphic Interface
   - Frosted glass effect with translucent cards and columns
   - Dark mode by default with simple light/dark toggle
   - Deep green color scheme as the primary palette
   - Responsive design that works across all screen sizes

2. Interactive Card System
   - 3D card rotation based on mouse position
   - Smooth lift and drop animations during drag-and-drop
   - Expandable cards with detailed view
   - Context menu for quick actions
   - Comprehensive card attributes:
     * Title and description
     * Labels/tags
     * Due dates
     * Assignees
     * Priority levels
     * Attachments
     * Comments

3. Column Management
   - Four predefined columns:
     * Product Backlog
     * In Progress
     * Code Review
     * Done
   - Adjustable column widths
   - Smooth animations during card transitions

4. Search & Organization
   - Global search functionality across all cards
   - Auto-save feature for all changes
   - Drag-and-drop reordering within and between columns

# User Experience

User Personas:
1. Primary User
   - Software developers and project managers
   - Values visual organization and smooth interactions
   - Appreciates modern design aesthetics
   - Needs quick access to task information

Key User Flows:
1. Card Management
   - Create new card with basic info
   - Drag card between columns
   - Expand card for detailed view/edit
   - Access quick actions via context menu

2. Board Organization
   - Search for specific cards
   - Adjust column widths
   - Toggle light/dark mode
   - View and update card details

UI/UX Considerations:
- Emphasis on smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Clear visual hierarchy through glassmorphic design
- Consistent 3D interactions for engagement

# Technical Architecture

System Components:
1. Frontend
   - Next.js 15 App Router
   - React 19 with Server Components
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - HeadlessUI for accessible components

2. Data Layer
   - JSON file-based storage
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Simple file system operations

Data Models:
```typescript
interface Board {
  columns: Column[];
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
}

interface Column {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  width: number;
  cards: Card[];
}

interface Card {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  labels: Label[];
  dueDate?: Date;
  assignees: string[];
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  attachments: Attachment[];
  comments: Comment[];
  columnId: string;
  order: number;
}
```

# Development Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation & Basic UI (MVP)
- Project setup with Next.js 15 and core dependencies
- Basic board layout with four columns
- Simple card component with title and description
- Basic drag-and-drop functionality
- JSON file storage implementation
- Dark mode implementation

Phase 2: Enhanced Visuals & Interactions
- Glassmorphic design implementation
- 3D card rotation effects
- Drag and drop animations
- Column width adjustment
- Expanded card view modal
- Context menu implementation

Phase 3: Card Features & Search
- Complete card attributes implementation
- Card labels and priority
- Assignees and due dates
- Attachments and comments
- Global search functionality
- Auto-save implementation

Phase 4: Polish & Performance
- Animation refinements
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Final styling adjustments

# Logical Dependency Chain

1. Foundation (Must be built first)
   - Project setup and configuration
   - Basic board layout
   - Simple card data structure
   - JSON storage implementation

2. Core Functionality
   - Basic drag-and-drop
   - Column structure
   - Card creation/editing

3. Visual Enhancement
   - Glassmorphic design
   - Dark mode
   - 3D card effects
   - Animations

4. Advanced Features
   - Extended card attributes
   - Search functionality
   - Context menu
   - Auto-save

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:
1. 3D Card Effects
   - Risk: Performance issues with many cards
   - Mitigation: Optimize animations, use hardware acceleration

2. Glassmorphic Design
   - Risk: Inconsistent appearance across browsers
   - Mitigation: Fallback styles, progressive enhancement

3. JSON Storage
   - Risk: Data corruption during saves
   - Mitigation: Atomic writes, validation before save

MVP Considerations:
- Focus on core drag-drop functionality first
- Ensure basic card management works before adding advanced features
- Implement visual effects incrementally

Resource Optimization:
- Use built-in Next.js features for optimization
- Implement lazy loading for card details
- Optimize animation performance

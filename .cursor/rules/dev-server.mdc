- **Development Server Management:**
  - **DO NOT** restart or run the development server (`npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `next dev`) if it's already running
  - The user typically has the dev server running continuously during development
  - Always assume the development server is running unless explicitly told otherwise

- **When Making Changes:**
  - Next.js automatically hot-reloads on file changes
  - No manual server restart needed for most code changes
  - Focus on code edits rather than server management

- **Exceptions (Only restart if explicitly requested):**
  - User specifically asks to restart the server
  - Changes to [next.config.js](mdc:next.config.js) that require a restart
  - Changes to [package.json](mdc:package.json) dependencies that require reinstallation
  - Environment variable changes that require server restart

- **Communication:**
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Make code changes and let hot reload handle updates
  // The changes will be reflected automatically in the browser
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Suggest restarting the dev server unnecessarily
  // "Let me restart the dev server to apply these changes"
  ```

- **Best Practices:**
  - Trust Next.js hot reload capabilities
  - Make incremental changes and test in browser
  - Only suggest server actions when truly necessary
  - Assume the user has their development environment properly set up

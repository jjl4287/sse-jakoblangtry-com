- **Board Header Layout Logic**
  - The board header in [`BoardHeader.tsx`](mdc:src/app/components/board/BoardHeader.tsx) no longer requires `translateX` animations.
  - This is because the sidebar is now part of the document flow and pushes content naturally instead of overlaying it.
  - **Rule:**
    - The board header should use a simple `<div>` container for the title section.
    - No `motion.div` or `translateX` animations are needed.
    - The `sidebarOpen` prop can still be passed for potential future use, but should not affect positioning.
  - **Purpose:** The sidebar now works like a traditional sidebar that pushes content to the right, eliminating the need for manual positioning adjustments.

  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Use simple div without animations
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <InlineEdit
      value={title}
      onChange={onChange}
      // ... other props
    />
  </div>

  // ❌ DON'T: Use motion.div with translateX animations (old overlay system)
  // <motion.div
  //   animate={{ x: sidebarOpen ? 0 : 40 }}
  //   className="flex items-center"
  // >
  ```

- **Migration Notes:**
  - The old `translateX` animation was designed to avoid overlap with a fixed-positioned toggle button.
  - With the new layout system, content is naturally positioned without manual adjustments.
  - The toggle button is now positioned within the board content area rather than over the sidebar.
